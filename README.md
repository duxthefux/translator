# Translator

Translator is a server and UI for managing translations for development projects.

The backend is written in Rust, and the frontend in React.

The data is stored in SQLite for now, but can be trivially swapped out for
PostgresQL or MySQL.

This is at a very early stage, expect breakage and missing / buggy functionality.

Translator can already be used relatively safely though,
